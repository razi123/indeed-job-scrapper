job summary
amazon's simple storage service (s3) offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. s3’s automated reasoning group (s3-arg) develops and applies automated reasoning techniques to deliver correct, secure, durable, and available distributed systems and storage services. s3 is complex: it consists of hundreds of micro-services each of which is a distributed system. with a very large number of servers and 10s of millions of requests per second, it is also highly concurrent. s3 has a sizable codebase, developed and maintained by a large team of engineers. getting such a complex and fast-evolving system right requires developing cutting edge automated reasoning methods that are continuously integrated into the software development process. this is what our team does.

we are a diverse team and are looking for teammates who are enthusiastic to work on these problems and further the state of the art with us. we are seeking candidates who are deep in one area of expertise but also broad enough to take on the most complex cloud computing challenges. if you are interested in exploring, please e-mail s3-arg-jobs@amazon.com.

key job responsibilities
researching, designing and developing innovative solutions to complex problems in storage systems such as s3
defining and executing on a research roadmap for s3. you’ll know and talk with your stakeholders on a regular basis, as well as using data and metrics to understand how your service is used, and build and deliver on a roadmap that delights our customers
develop novel automated reasoning techniques and tools while working with the engineering team to integrate them into our projects
interact closely with the open-source, academic and research communities
work with other acclaimed engineers and world famous scientists

a day in the life
we work on techniques ranging from deductive proofs to model checking, from static analysis to runtime verification of protocols. we work both at the design and the code level, and connecting the two is essential for us. we partner with development teams to make sure that our methods are deployed across s3 and that correctness is maintained as the software evolves. we have had significant success with adoption and we are key contributors to recent s3 launches such as strong consistency. we are developing innovative methods all the time. we publish our results at conferences and journals.
