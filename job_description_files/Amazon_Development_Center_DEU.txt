job summary
do you want to have a worldwide impact in robotics? the robotics ai team at amazon builds high-performance, real-time robotic systems that can perceive, learn, and act intelligently alongside humans—at amazon scale. we invent and scale ai systems for robotics in fulfillment. our mission is to enable robots to interact safely, efficiently, and fluently with the clutter and uncertainty of real-world fulfillment centers. we hire and develop subject matter experts in robotics with a focus on mechanism design, workcell automation, and iterative prototyping.

the robotics ai team is seeking broad, curious engineers to join our diverse team. in addition to holistically designing, building, and delivering end-to-end robotic systems, our team is responsible for the core infrastructure and tools that serve as the backbone of our robotic applications, enabling roboticists, machine learning scientists, and software engineers to collaborate and deploy systems in the field.

we are seeking a interdisciplinary systems engineer to help with our robotic prototypes and work cell deployments. you will design, build, and test innovative robotic systems and their components such as the end of arm tools.

this role includes ownership of decision explanation, process management, fault detection, monitoring, a/b testing, simulation, hardware integration, and more. this work spans prototypes in the lab as well as wide-deployment systems. you will have the opportunity to learn and be a part of an interdisciplinary team building all parts of the robot hardware and software stack.

key job responsibilities
design first of a kind robotic systems for manipulation in cluttered and constrained environments
work with an interdisciplinary team to improve and maintain product designs including specification, design, prototyping, validation and testing
work with the operations, manufacturing, supply chain and quality organizations as well as vendors to ensure a smooth production transition of design changes
write requirements and functional specifications, design verification plans, and functional test procedures
exhibit role model behaviors of thorough engineering analysis and cradle to grave ownership
mentor colleagues
advanced degree (ms or phd) in mechanical engineering, computer science, computer engineering, or equivalent work experience.
hardware integration (e.g. hardware release cycles, heterogeneous hardware fleets).
building and testing real-time or safety-critical systems.
strong organizational skills and the ability to work well with teams of hardware and software engineers
proficiency with agile product lifecycle management plm software and eco’s.
significant experience with the hardware product development process.
demonstrated ability to develop deep understanding of the business and end user needs quickly, and can proficiently translate those needs into the right technology solution.
ability to effectively communicate concepts and proposals
desire and energy to work in a fast-paced agile environment
