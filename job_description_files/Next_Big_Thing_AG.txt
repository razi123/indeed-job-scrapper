we make dumb concrete smart !

concrete is the second most used material on earth after water. since its widespread usage by the ancient egyptians, chinese and romans, it has always been a simple mix of cement, water and aggregates. we use it to build our infrastructure, bridges, tunnels, our houses, our shelters, etc.

since its invention, the way from how we use it to how we test it hasnâ€™t changed drastically.

thanks to concr and its solution, we make an over 3000 years old dumb material smart. how ?

with our iot solution, we provide our customers with state-of-the-art wireless sensing devices and cloud-based monitoring and management tools to improve project management during construction work and enable remote maturity and quality concrete monitoring. we give concrete a voice that helps the construction industry increase efficiency, improve quality and reduce waste.

since our customer and project base has been growing rapidly in the last years, we are seeking a backend engineer to join our development team.
