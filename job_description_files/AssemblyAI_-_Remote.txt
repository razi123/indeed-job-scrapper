assemblyai is an ai company - we build powerful models to transcribe and understand audio data, exposed through simple apis.
hundreds of companies, and thousands of developers, use our apis to both transcribe and understand millions of videos, podcasts, phone calls, and zoom meetings every day. our apis power innovative products like conversational intelligence platforms, zoom meeting summarizers, content moderation, and automatic closed captioning.
we've been growing at breakneck speed, and are backed by leading investors including y combinator's ai fund, patrick and john collision (founders of stripe), nat friedman (former ceo of github), and daniel gross (entrepreneur & investor in companies including github, uber, coinbase, spacex, instacart, notion, and cruise automation).
assemblyai's speech-to-text apis are already trusted by fortune 500s, startups, and thousands of developers around the world, with well-known customers including spotify, algolia, dow jones, the wall street journal, and nbcuniversal. as part of a huge and emerging market, assemblyai is well on its way to becoming the leader in speech recognition and nlp.
