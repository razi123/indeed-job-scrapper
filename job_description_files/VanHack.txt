about the culture

flexibility: work from wherever you want, in the office, from home, or wherever inspires and motivates you.

sustainability: this is not a typical start-up. they want their engineers to be rested and able to perform. they offer a generous vacation allowance (28+ days a year) and the opportunity to speak with professional counsellors to support mental health - covered by the business

pragmatic: the company thrives on being pragmatic, allowing them to make the best decisions, rather than keeping to rigid processes and procedures that don’t work well for them

impactful: with a robust ci/cd process, and a full suite of automated tests, their engineers ship daily, allowing you to make an impact on the product from day one with peace of mind

agile & inclusively: they’ve developed their own kanban-based way of working that is constantly being improved and adapted by the self-organizing product-engineering teams. opinions and ideas are valued from all

quality: achieved by ensuring detailed stories and epics, high test coverage, a thorough code-review process, consciously taking on technical debt and an open culture of sharing opinions

organized: they strive for considered decisions, creating software that lasts. they document them in decision records, which any engineer in any team can drive

fostering growth: empowering employees who are determined to grow by providing a self-development budget and strong career advancement opportunities. support from your teammates to guide and encourage you to grow in your desired professional field

company culture: they believe a diverse industry is best served with a diverse workforce, and it is a great place to work, with recent employee surveys showing over 98% workplace satisfaction
